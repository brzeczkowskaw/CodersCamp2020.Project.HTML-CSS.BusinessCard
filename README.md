## General info
Project was prepared to present myself. I included short information about me and photo gallery from my trips. 
I started my work with page structure in HTML and styled it in CSS. Favicon was designed with Affinity Designer. 
Page includes navbar, introduction, photogallery with animation (zooming pictures), contact form, small animation and footer.
